When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when working with another person or from multiple workstations or you need to share your files
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to make sure of what you are bringing down before you mess with your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	use fork on github to copy a repository on github, use clone to copy a github repository down to your local workstation, use branch to create new commit path on your workstation
