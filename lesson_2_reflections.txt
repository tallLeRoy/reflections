What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a .git directory and the files it needs to track your repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area keeps track of changes to files in the repository that have not yet been committed This puts the changes into a format that the later commit can use without searching every file
